## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Formik
- Yup

### What I learned

For this challenge i decided to work with React and implement some of the things that i've been learning about it, i also implemented Formik and Yup for the form, i haven't worked with them much so it was really fun to learn all of the things i can do with them.

### Continued development

I would like to learn and work more about/with React, i'm new to it so i know there's a lot i don't know that can help me make my pages/apps more user friendly and also help me make my code more clean and easy to understand.

### Useful resources

- [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview) - Since i used Formik for the form, the official documentation was very helpful to understand all of the things i implemented.
- [React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The official React documentation helped me when i got stuck in something i didn't understand.
